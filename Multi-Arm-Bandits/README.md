# Multi-Armed-Bandits

Here are test and comparison results of some simple methods used in Reinforcement Learning(RL).All of them have been done on ten-armed test band.
For each method there have been slight variations in the way  ten-armed test band has been formulated.</br>

### 1.Epsilon-Greedy and Greedy actions

run the code:
>python3 greedy\\epsilon-greedy.py

#### Results are as follows:

### 2.Sample-Average vs Constant-step_size

run the code
>python3 Sample-avg\\constant-step_size.py

#### Results are as follows
