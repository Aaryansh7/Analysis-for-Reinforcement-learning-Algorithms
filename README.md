# Analysis of Reinforcement-learning Algorithms

Reinforcement Learning(RL) is a branch of Machine Learning that idealizes learning methods like Humans.It has evovled overtime and thus each learning algorithm has its own flavour.One needs to know which algorithm is most suitable to a given problem.Thus analysing RL methods becomes crucial.</br>

This repository contains most of the RL algorithms applied in a sample environment or through a simple problem.All of the problems have been based on the book "Reinforcement Learning:An Introduction by Sutton and Barto".
