# Monte Carlo Methods

Monte Carlo methods require only experience—sample sequences of states, actions, and rewards from actual or simulated interaction with an environment.Learning from actual experience is striking because it requires no prior knowledge of the environment’s dynamics, yet can still attain optimal behavior.</br>
Monte-Carlo methods are a type of model-free RL methods where one finds optimal control without prior knowledge of model.

Here are test and comparison results of some simple methods used in monte carlo methods under Reinforcement Learning(RL).</br>

### 1.Black Jack

run the code(as per the correct file path):
>python3 black_jack.py

#### Results are as follows:

### 2.Black Jack with Exploring Starts

run the code(as per the correct file path):
>python3 black_jack_es.py

#### Results are as follows: 
There are few discrepencies in the results as compared to the book results.I guess maybe its due to random behaviour , if you find out the mistake,let me know.</br>
I have published three results .By Analysis,the general policy is same.
